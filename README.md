## Data
**[National Survey of Drug Use and Health (2015-2019)| SAMHDA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bgallamoza/national-survey-of-drug-use-and-health-20152019)**

The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) is the "leading source of statistical information on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco and mental health issues in the United States" (SAMHSA). The abundance of Yes/No questions regarding the usage of illicit drugs make this dataset valuable for binary classification problems. During 2015, the survey received a partial redesign, creating "broken trends" from pre-2015 and post-2015. This is dataset contains every year of the NSDUH survey after the major restructuring in 2015.
